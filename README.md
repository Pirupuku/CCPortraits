WoW 1.12.1 Addon - Puts class icons and CC on player Unit Frames! Modified ClassPortraits_Vanilla

This is my first addon for Vanilla 1.12.1 WoW. It's as stated in the description a modification of the original addon ClassPortraits_Vanilla.

Most buffs and debuffs that have anything to do with Crowd Control (CC) should be implemented. If there is any missing let me know and I try to add them as soon as possible.

Also a combat log "reader" would be nice to be implemented. That way it would be possible to track CC buffs and debuffs of the Target Frame as well - to some extent!
Further this addon as of now just works with the default UI - so not compatible with UIs like Luna Unit Frames, pfUI, zUI, modUI etc etc unless you disable the Player and Target Frame module.

Any feedback would be nice!
